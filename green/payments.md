### Payments for Free Software Programmers

- How much free software programmers should be paid as they wrote most of the components running the Internet services today?

In 2026, the debate over how much free software (Open Source) programmers should be paid has moved from a moral argument to a structural necessity. Recent studies from Harvard Business School and groups like Catena-X reveal that open-source software generates an estimated $8.8 trillion in economic value—more than three times the total global spending on proprietary software.

To sustain this "$8.8 trillion backbone," the payment models are shifting toward a market-rate "Infrastructure Wage."

1. The Market Gap: What They Are vs. Should Be Paid
Currently, a massive disparity exists between the value created and the compensation received:
 * The Reality (2026): According to the Tidelift State of the Maintainer report, 60% of maintainers are still unpaid hobbyists. Even those who are paid often earn 10–50 times less than their market rate if they rely on donations (averaging under $10,000/year for many solo maintainers).
 * The "Fair" Target: Professional software developers in the U.S. now average $113,515 to $148,500 annually, while high-level specialists in security or AI—areas where most critical open-source work happens—earn between $279,000 and $600,000.
 * The "Insurance" Logic: Critics argue maintainers should be paid at the top 10% of the industry rate ($378k+), as their work prevents multi-billion dollar outages and security breaches (like the 2024 XZ Utils hack).

2. Emerging "Sovereign" Funding Models

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and European leaders have different views on where this money should come from:
 * The EU Sovereign Tech Fund (EU-STF): Europe is treating code as a public utility. They are funding the maintenance of "Digital Public Goods" to ensure sovereignty from U.S. Big Tech.
 * Rubio’s "Strategic Assets" Approach: The U.S. is increasingly using Department of Defense (DoD) and State Department grants to pay maintainers of critical libraries (like OpenSSL or Linux), but only if those projects align with "Western Security" standards.

3. The Metanarchy Solution: "Proof of Contribution"

The Metanarchy movement argues that neither corporations nor states should decide who gets paid. Instead, they advocate for algorithmic compensation:
 * Dependency Streaming: Using protocols like tea.xyz or Radicle, a programmer's wallet receives a micro-fraction of every dollar spent by a company that uses their code in their "tech stack."
 * Smart Contract Royalties: Much like music royalties, "Code Royalties" ensure that if a piece of software is used by a million-dollar service, the original author receives a proportionate, automated cut.

4. The Bottom Line: What is "Fair"?

Economists now suggest a "1% Tax on Digital Revenue" for large enterprises to fund the open-source libraries they use. If 1% of the $3.4 trillion spent on proprietary software were diverted to open-source maintainers, it would provide a $34 billion annual fund—enough to pay 100,000 top-tier maintainers a salary of $340,000/year.

Would you like me to find the current "Security Scorecard" for a specific open-source library to see if it is currently underfunded and at risk?
