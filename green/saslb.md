### Songkhla Alor Setar Landbridge

#### Estimate costs for Songkhla Alor Setar Landbridge

- | Grand Total (Regional) | ~75 Billion THB | ~$2.2 Billion |
- Only < 10% of National "Land Bridge" Project (Chumphon–Ranong)
 * Total Investment: ~997.68 billion THB ($28 – 30 billion USD).

To understand the costs of a "land bridge" between Songkhla and Alor Setar, we have to distinguish between the massive Chumphon–Ranong Land Bridge (the primary national project) and the regional Southern Economic Corridor rail links that specifically serve the Songkhla–Malaysia route.

Here is the breakdown of estimated costs as of February 2026:

1. Regional Rail & Port Link (Songkhla to Alor Setar)

This project is part of Thailand's Phase 2 Double-Track Railway expansion. Unlike the 1-trillion-baht land bridge to the north, this is focused on connecting existing ports to the Malaysian rail network.
 * Surat Thani – Hat Yai – Songkhla Rail: ~64.58 billion THB ($1.8 – 1.9 billion USD).
   * This is the critical "missing link" that will bring trains back to Songkhla town and its deep-sea port.
 * Hat Yai – Padang Besar (Border) Upgrade: ~7.57 billion THB ($215 – 230 million USD).
   * This covers the electrification and double-tracking of the final 45km to the Malaysian border.
 * Perlis Inland Port (Malaysia Side): ~492 million MYR ($110 million USD).
   * Malaysia is investing in this "dry port" near the border to handle the increased container traffic coming from Songkhla and other Thai hubs.
Estimated Total for Regional Link Infrastructure: ~$2.2 billion USD.

2. National "Land Bridge" Project (Chumphon–Ranong)

If you are referring to the official Thai Land Bridge project, which is often compared to the Songkhla route, the costs are significantly higher:
 * Total Investment: ~997.68 billion THB ($28 – 30 billion USD).
 * Phase 1 Cost (2025–2030): ~609 billion THB.
 * Components:
   * New Rail (90km): ~109.28 billion THB.
   * Motorway: ~162.19 billion THB.
   * Two Deep-Sea Ports: The remainder, including massive commercial/multi-purpose zones.

3. Economic Impact & Cost-Efficiency

The "Songkhla–Alor Setar" corridor is often seen as a more cost-effective "mini-land bridge" compared to the trillion-baht project.
 * Logistics Savings: The Thai Ministry of Transport estimates that completing the double-track rail to the border can reduce Thailand's overall logistics costs from 14.1% of GDP to roughly 10%.
 * Trade Goal: Malaysia and Thailand are targeting $30 billion USD in annual bilateral trade by 2027, much of which will rely on this rail corridor.

#### Summary of Costs

| Project Component | Estimated Cost (Local Currency) | Estimated Cost (USD) |
|---|---|---|
| Songkhla–Hat Yai Rail | 64.58 Billion THB | ~$1.85 Billion |
| Hat Yai–Border Rail | 7.57 Billion THB | ~$220 Million |
| Malaysian Inland Port | 492 Million MYR | ~$110 Million |
| Grand Total (Regional) | ~75 Billion THB | ~$2.2 Billion |
