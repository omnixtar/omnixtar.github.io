Omni*Web is a project aimed at building a truly decentralised web, owned and operated by individual users and free software programmers, based on its novel and unique TRIMEDIA business model, which is an abbreviation for Training, Infrastructure, Metaprogramming and Digital Assets. 

Omni*Web most important innovation using Omnihash, a 53 bit hash number encoded in base 64 string, as decentralised identifiers of users, digital assets and infrastructure, thereby monetizing these digital assets and infrastructure. 

This means anyone with a mobile phone or computer at home will be able to set up Omni*Web servers on their mobile device or computer using I2P (Invisible Internet Project), bypassing Domain Name System, at zero costs, and even start earning money using Omnihash to record their server operation statistics. 

Next, anyone can join Omni*Web Training and use its Train-Advertise-Develop model to learn and develop training materials, recruit more trainees and get paid with TRISPECIES payments, which includes fiat national currencies, cryptocurrencies and gold silver bullion, all using Omnihash to track the activities of learning, recruitment, advertising etc. 

Metaprogramming is perhaps the best kept secret by all top tech companies, which simplifies conventional programming languages like JavaScript or Python, into reverse polish notation similar to FORTH programming language, thus making it easy for any from 8 years old to 80 years old to pick up programming easily, and even contribute to the development of Omni*Web itself, while getting paid with Omnihash as well. 

Thus the four elements TRIMEDIA of Omni*Web, namely Training, Infrastructure, Metaprogramming and Digital Assets. 

In the long term, say by 2030, Omni*Web merely aims to achieve 0.1% of top five tech companies revenues, which include Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Google and Apple, coincidentally abbreviated as MMAGA. They collectively made over USD 1.6 trillion in 2023. This means even at 0.1%, individual users and free software programmers participating in Omni*Web could be making USD 1.6 billion annually by 2030.

Hope is not something abstract, but an essential ingredient to sustain a collective effort towards a common goal. As we have laid the theoretical foundation and plans for Omni*Web, what is needed next is taking actions step by step and spreading the message to recruit more people, and remember:

- The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. 
- A million people one step each equals a million steps.
