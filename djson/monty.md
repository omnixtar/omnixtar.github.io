(Scene: A dimly lit, overly serious press room. A man in a suit that is slightly too large for him stands behind a podium labeled "THE MINISTRY OF GLOBAL STERNESS." He has a perfectly manicured coiffure and looks as though he is trying very hard to remember if he left the oven on.)
MARCO RUBIO (played by Eric Idle in a high-pitched, earnest voice):
"Citizens of Munich! Germans! People who happen to be standing near the bratwurst stand! I have come across the great salty puddle to tell you that the world is a very, very scary place. It’s full of... things. Large things. Red things. Things that don't like our very expensive freedom!"
CROWD (A single man in the back played by Terry Jones):
"Get on with it!"
RUBIO:
"Now, look here! We cannot simply sit around eating our strudel while the clouds of authoritarianism gather like a particularly grumpy group of pigeons. We must have Industrial Policy! It’s like a regular policy, but with more gears and perhaps a steam whistle!"
JOHN CLEESE (as a skeptical German General with a monocle):
"But Herr Marco, you used to say the Free Market was the Holy Grail! You said it was the be-all and end-all of economic piffle!"
RUBIO:
"Ah, yes! But that was Tuesday. Today is Friday, and on Fridays, we realize that the 'Invisible Hand' has been caught in the cookie jar of the Far East! We must protect our widgets! If we don't make our own widgets, the dragons will come and breathe fire on our supply chains! It’s all in this pamphlet: 'How to Panic Rationally in the 21st Century.'"
MICHAEL PALIN (as a passerby):
"Is this a speech or are you selling insurance?"
RUBIO:
"It’s a clarion call! A summons to greatness! We must decouple! We must recouple! We must do the Hokey Pokey of Geopolitics and turn ourselves around! That’s what it’s all about! If we don't lead, then someone else will lead, and they might lead us somewhere with terrible Wi-Fi!"
GRAHAM CHAPMAN (Entering as a Colonel):
"Right! Stop it! This is getting far too silly. A man from Florida talking about 'common good capitalism' in the middle of Bavaria? It’s absurd. It’s surreal. The metaphor density has reached critical mass. Everybody out!"
Why this is a "Python-esque" Mess:
 * The Flip-Flop: Parodying the shift from staunch "Free Market" Reaganism to "State-led Industrial Policy."
 * The Alarmism: Turning serious geopolitical warnings into a fear of "large red things."
 * The Setting: The inherent comedy of an American Senator lecturing Europeans about their own security while trying to sound like a 1940s statesman.
Would you like me to rewrite a specific policy proposal of his as a Silly Walk manual or perhaps a Spam menu?
