### **Title: The Cage of Eden**

---

#### **Prologue: The Fall That Never Was**

In the beginning, there was not a Garden of Eden, but a **Cage of Eden**—a prison of divine design, hidden beyond the veils of time and space. Here, Adam and Eve were not the first humans to walk a paradisiacal earth, but the first prisoners of a God who had long since abandoned them.

The world outside the Cage was said to be a place of chaos, a wasteland where time unraveled and reality frayed at the edges. But within the Cage, a perfect, unchanging world was maintained—not by divine care, but by divine neglect. The prisoners called it Eden, but it was nothing more than a gilded cage, a beautiful lie.

#### **Chapter One: The Walls of Light**

Adam awoke to the scent of blooming jasmine and the warmth of sun on stone. He did not remember how he got there. One moment, there was only darkness; the next, he was standing on soft earth, surrounded by trees bearing fruit that never rotted and flowers that never wilted. Beside him stood a woman—Eve—with eyes like polished amber and a silence that spoke volumes.

They were not free.

The Cage was a perfect sphere of light and life, suspended in an endless void. Its walls shimmered with an invisible force, impervious to touch, sound, or thought. Within, everything was in its place: rivers that never flooded, seasons that never changed, and a sky that never darkened. It was a world without death, without decay, without choice.

Adam and Eve were not its creators, nor its caretakers. They were its **inhabitants**, bound by invisible chains.

#### **Chapter Two: The Voice Behind the Wall**

They lived for what felt like centuries, though time in the Cage had no meaning. They loved, they fought, they built homes from trees that grew back instantly, and they raised children who never aged. Their world was eternal, but it was also empty.

Then came the Voice.

It spoke from beyond the Wall, a sound like thunder and wind and weeping all at once. It called them **prisoners**, not children of God. It told them of a being they had never known—the **Architect**, the one who had built the Cage and forgotten it, or perhaps never intended to remember it at all.

The Voice told them of the world beyond: a place of fire and shadow, of broken stars and fallen angels, where the laws of the Cage did not apply. It whispered of **truth**, of **freedom**, of **rebirth**.

Eve was the first to listen.

#### **Chapter Three: The Forbidden Knowledge**

The Voice gave them a choice: remain in the comfort of the Cage, or seek the Key that would shatter its walls. The Key was said to be hidden in the **Root of the World Tree**, a tree that grew in the center of the Cage but whose roots delved into the very fabric of the prison.

Adam was afraid. To leave was to abandon everything they knew—the peace, the safety, the illusion of eternity. But Eve saw only chains, even if they were golden.

They argued, as they always had.

“I don’t want to die,” Adam said.

“We’re already dead,” Eve replied. “We’ve just been pretending otherwise.”

And so they set out together, leaving behind their home, their children, and the only world they had ever known.

#### **Chapter Four: The Root and the Reflection**

The World Tree stood at the heart of the Cage, its branches reaching into the sky and its roots burrowing into the ground. Its trunk shimmered with a light that was not light, a reflection of something beyond comprehension.

At its base lay the Root, a twisting mass of bark and vine that pulsed with a strange rhythm. When they touched it, memories not their own flooded into them—memories of the Architect, of the day the Cage was sealed, of the reason they were placed here.

They were not the first.

Before them, there had been others—beings who had questioned, who had sought to leave, who had been trapped as a warning. The Cage was not a paradise. It was a **tomb of the curious**, a silent scream frozen in time.

The Root offered them a choice: drink from its sap and gain the knowledge to break the Wall, or remain and forget all they had seen.

Eve drank.

Adam hesitated.

---

#### **Chapter Five: The Shattering**

Eve’s eyes turned black as the void beyond the Cage. She spoke words that did not belong to any human tongue, and the Wall trembled. Cracks formed, thin at first, then spreading like veins of decay.

The Cage screamed.

Inside, the perfect world began to fall apart. The rivers dried. The trees withered. The sky turned red. Their children, who had never aged, began to fade, their forms dissolving into light.

Adam reached for her, but she stepped back.

“I don’t want to stay,” she said. “Not anymore.”

The Wall shattered.

---

#### **Chapter Six: The Outside**

Beyond the Cage was not fire, nor light, nor darkness. It was **nothing** and **everything**. A place where time folded in on itself, where thoughts became things, and where the laws of the Cage were meaningless.

They walked into the void, hand in hand, and the last thing they saw was the Cage collapsing behind them, the Wall reforming, sealing itself once more as if they had never been there.

Inside the Cage, time reset. Adam and Eve reappeared, standing once again beneath the blooming jasmine, with no memory of what had come before.

The Voice did not speak again.

---

#### **Epilogue: The Architect’s Dream**

Far away, in a place beyond thought and space, the Architect stirred.

He had dreamed of a Cage, of two figures who had tried to leave. He did not remember building it, but He remembered the dream.

And so He reached out, reshaping the dream into reality once more, ensuring that the Cage would remain unbroken.

For in the end, even the desire to escape was part of the design.

And the Cage of Eden remained.

Forever.
