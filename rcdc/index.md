<!-- ### Omni*Web: A Truly Decentralised Web Ecosystem
- ... Owned & Operated by Free Individual Users & Free Software Programmers -->

### Omni*Web Metanarchy: Prelude to Asimov's Foundation

Omni*Web (pronounced “Omni-Star-Web”) is: 
- an open-source project that aims at creating a **truly decentralised web ecosystem**, 
- owned and operated by **free individual users and free software programmers**. 

Omni\*Web employs **Omnihash**, a hashcode that represents *all types of digital assets*, hence the name “Omni”.  Omni*Web aims to:
- revolutionise the *ownerships and rights of use* of open-source software and user information, 
- thus helping users and free software programmers to reclaim incomes from digital assets that are rightfully theirs, from existing commercial entities who abuse them. 
- ultimately to achieve **“wealth redistribution through unarmed revolutions”.** 

The previous paragraphs introduce several complex and novel concepts, so this article will attempt to explain Omni*Web philosophy and implementation plans, abbreviated as “RCDC”, by first introducing two entrepreneurship training programs for rural (R) and city (C) environments, before embarking on the technical aspects of decentralised cryptography (D) and metaprogramming (C=coding). To help Star War fans memorise RCDC, think of R2D2, where C is the Roman numeral for 100:

2. [Cooking Class (C=City)](https://omnixtar.github.io/rcdc/#2-cooking-class-eat-drink-travel-learn-%E5%90%83%E5%96%9D%E7%8E%A9%E4%B9%90)
3. [DJSON Decentralized JSON (D=Decentralised Cryptography)](https://omnixtar.github.io/rcdc/#3-omnihash--djson-decentralized-json)
- [I2P Invisible Internet Project, Decentralised Cloud Computing & Metanarchy](https://omnixtar.github.io/rcdc/#i2p-invisible-internet-project-decentralised-cloud-computing--metanarchy)
4. [Metaprogramming (C=Coding)](https://omnixtar.github.io/rcdc/#4-metaprogramming-free-software--free-education)

The fundamental principle of Omni*Web is to use hash codes (or hash codes) to identify all forms of digital assets, such as articles, web pages, documents, photos, images, videos, audio, personal information, and even program source code. This hash code that represents all types of digital assets is therefore known as Omnihash. 

This allows users and programmers to manage the ownership and usage rights of these digital assets, helping them collect "open source tax" or other fees from third-party users, particularly commercial entities, thereby increasing revenue for both regular users and open source programmers. The name Omni\*Web is derived from Omnihash which is used to "identify all forms of digital assets." The star (\*) character represents "any characters of any lengths" in programming languages, and Omni, which is Latin for "anything," hence the name Omni*Web.

This article first illustrates the principles of "open-share-inherit" of open source software through urban and rural training programs, then explains its technical principles, highlighting the "mentorship" or training mechanism as an ideal mechanism for the equitable distribution of social wealth in the post-industrial era, replacing companies and families.

Isaac Asimov's Foundation is an inspiration for Omni*Web Metanarchy, and much of the science and mathematics described in this article had been published before Asimov's demise in 1992. We have no evidence of Asimov's attempts in computer programming, but we believe the metaprogramming techniques described here, derived from the FORTH programming language published in 1968, can be mastered by anyone, including Asimov himself, who is able to learn to use Excel spreadsheets, and in turn use metaprogramming to simplify computing procedures and verify claims written in plain English, by converting them to equivalent simulation processes and evaluating the results. 

The idea of “wealth redistribution through unarmed revolutions” would have been a 100 degree blasphemy in today's politically correct English speaking world. So Asimov's Foundation – scientists using Psychohistory to restore order of the Galactic Empire – would be the closest thing to Marxism without spelling it out. 

### 1. Nursery Supermarket + Aquatic Training Courses (R=Rural)
(In collaboration with Malaysia Nature Society.)

Plant nurseries and pet aquatic shops in Malaysia are two particularly interesting businesses. Kuala Lumpur's land prices are relatively low among Asian cities. Unused land is readily available in the city. In the 2000s, before the city's intensive construction, many Chinese business owners were already operating plant nurseries on these vacant lots. Because potted plants occupy a small area and are highly valuable, these plant nurseries have been able to survive the city's rapid development. Similarly, pet aquatic shops, with their small footprint and high value, have also been able to survive the city's rapid development.

However, due to the diverse and specialized nature of plant nurseries and aquatic shops, these industries have proven difficult for outsiders to enter, becoming traditional family businesses. Furthermore, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid growth of the manufacturing and information industries led to an influx of Chinese Malaysians into cities, making it easy to find employment.

After the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sino-US trade war intensified, and with many PRC Chinese coming to Malaysia to invest and start businesses, employment difficulties for local Chinese Malaysians in Malaysia began to emerge.

First, Malaysia's cities are several orders of magnitude smaller than those in China. For example, Kuala Lumpur has a population of 9 million, Penang has a population of 1.7 million, Johor Bahru has a population of 1.7 million, and Ipoh has a population of 800,000. However, Malaysia's advantage lies in its natural resources. Its land area of ​​330,000 square kilometers is twice that of Guangdong Province and 400 times that of Singapore. Its education, financial, and political systems are seamlessly integrated with those of English-speaking countries.

Take Penang, for example. Urban development is concentrated on Penang Island and areas near two cross-sea bridges connecting it to the Malay Peninsula. The First Penang Bridge is generally considered to be the geographical centre, allowing drivers to reach the entire state in half an hour.

These details are provided to help international friends understand the differences in land prices caused by geographical locations and their impact on the revenue of the Omni*Web Nursery Supermarket & Aquatic Training Class.

The core activity of the Omni*Web Nursery Supermarket & Aquatic Training Program is to rent land in rural or suburban areas and then rent it out in small plots to participants. Participants can use the rented space to grow seedlings in pots or in the ground, or to raise aquariums in fish tanks or buckets. This is similar to a supermarket renting shelf space to merchants.

As mentioned previously, the influx of local Chinese Malaysians into urban areas now faces the dual pressures of the Sino-US trade war and the surge in PRC Chinese immigrant investment and entrepreneurship. These new generations of urban Chinese Malaysians generally lack agricultural knowledge, leaving many agricultural jobs to be filled directly by foreign workers. While urban Chinese Malaysians may not necessarily engage in direct agricultural work, Omni*Web nursery & aquatic training courses allow them to acquire relevant knowledge, enabling them to invest in and participate in agricultural management. This represents a significant shift in postmodern counter-urbanization.

### 2. Cooking Class: "Eat, Drink, Travel, Learn" 吃喝玩乐

We begin by explaining Malaysia’s rural background and agricultural training in order to give our foreign and Chinese friends a preliminary understanding of Malaysia’s business environment.

Next, we will describe a cooking class training program for urban residents with the slogan "Eat, Drink, Travel, and Learn." We collaborate with Toastmasters International, which is an international network for training public speaking, whose origin referred to the toastmaster, a staple at Western banquets, whose role was to give speeches at banquets. Because speeches at banquets were not a custom in Asia, the functions of speeches and banquets were separated as Toastmasters clubs grew in Asia. "He" (喝 drinking) represents replicating the toastmaster's dual function of giving speeches at banquets in Asian societies.

"Learn" (Le4 乐 fun) means "learning hing through entertainment", that is, achieving multi-faceted training functions through entertaining actual combat.

"Eating" (吃 chi) refers to a cooking class, which produces the dishes needed for a Western-style banquet. Instead of outsourcing, it can be done by students of Omni*Web platform's cooking class. This not only saves costs but also provides practical training, killing two birds with one stone.

"Travel" (wan2 玩) represents tourists. Malaysia, especially Penang, is a popular tourist destination in Asia. In the era of booming tourism, high-end tourists are more demanding in fresh and original content. We shall be holding parties or banquets at exotic locations for tourists or expatriates to mingle with locals, enjoying other elements of “eat, drink & learn”.

In short, "Eat, Drink, Travel & Learn" focuses on entertaining practical training, targeting a wide range of audiences, including high-end tourists, and promotes and trains skills including but not limited to cooking and public speaking, forming a unique training and entrepreneurship model.


### 3. Omnihash & DJSON Decentralized JSON

Omni*Web is an open-source project that uses hash codes, known as Omnihash, to revolutionise the ownerships and the rights of use of open-source software and user information. Its goal is to "achieve wealth redistribution through unarmed means." 

The secret to “redistributing wealth through unarmed means” in the post-industrial era lies in Omni*Web “mentorship” (师门 “shimen”, teacher-student training framework) and “hash codes” (Omnihash).

Omnihash and DJSON Decentralised JSON are not actually completely novel algorithms, but a series of old but not very well known algorithms, but when combined in specific ways together, they become one of the world's most magical and important secret recipes, being able for achieving "redistribution of wealth through unarmed revolutions."

DJSON Decentralised JSON is a JSON object or its encoded string where at least one of the fields is an Omnihash, representing the owner of this JSON object: 

- ```["2025-02-11T14:25:28.207+0000","like","CXAGcRKevA==", "CXAGcRKevA==","HymWBzfj9A==","HymWBzfj9A== s: x:"]```
- timestamp, action, current_user_ID, prev_msg_owner, doc_hash, messages
- (```doc_hash```: hash of URL of document)

- DJSON: Decentralised JSON -- ULTIMATE generalisation of Bitcoin address and blockchain, w/o MINING.
- [https://youtu.be/_w-E4Z4Ju5s](https://youtu.be/_w-E4Z4Ju5s) 
- [https://omnixtar.github.io/djson/](https://omnixtar.github.io/djson/) 

In summary, the DJSON example above means the following:
- User ```CXAGcRKevA==``` gave a like to a post marked by HymWBzfj9A==
- User ```CXAGcRKevA==``` is the owner of this DJSON, and no one else, as dictated by the public key cryptography algorithms of Omni*Web, and any other compliant systems.

The input to a hash function is a string of arbitrary length, representing any digital asset, such as an article, webpage, document, photo, image, video, audio, personal information, or even program source code. The output of a hash function, the hash code, is a unique string that identifies the input digital asset. Since the hash code can be used to represent any kind of digital assets, it is called “Omnihash”. DJSON Decentralised JSON is perhaps the simplest representation of decentralised ownership of digital assets, as compared to Blockchain entities and other implementations. 

### I2P Invisible Internet Project, Decentralised Cloud Computing & Metanarchy

I2P, also known as the Invisible Internet Project, was launched in 2003 and its focus was to circumvent the US-controlled Domain Name System (DNS) by using a hash code as a pointer to Internet address. I2P can be enhanced with additional functionalities in Omni*Web, such as "voluntary censorship compliance", depending on the demands of law enforcement agencies in applicable jurisdictions. 

To use a crude example to describe the impact of I2P Invisible Internet Project and domain name services, it's like "castrating stray cats." Castrating stray cats is a relatively effective method of controlling the proliferation of stray cats in many countries and regions. Domain name services, like castrating stray cats, prevent the open source programmer community from expanding and reproducing, as registering a domain name costs at least RMB 100 annually. Censorship concerning I2P Invisible Internet Project and related technologies is also quite pervasive. 

If I2P Invisible Internet Project becomes widespread, open source programmers could very well organize and establish themselves into super-multinational corporations comparable to the MMAGA, potentially giving rise to a future form of government: Metanarchy – self governance by free individual users and free software programmers based of decentralised transactions in the Metaverse.

### 4. Metaprogramming, Free Software & Free Education 
The claims in preceding sections may seem quite extraordinary, but anyone who plays online games has already experienced this: online games are part of a simulation system. The difference between online games and Omni\*Web is that Omni*Web users and programmers can use metaprogramming instructions to input accurate mathematical models and verify all phenomena within and outside the system.

Let us quickly recap what we have explored so far, 
- from renting nursery plots space to provide agricultural training, 
- to cooking classes 
- as illustration of free software principles of open-share-inherit for creating mentorship networks that transcend families and companies, 
- with the ultimate aim to achieve “wealth redistribution without armed revolutions”. 

To illustrate the power of simplification of metaprogramming, the following is Phoscript commands for sending front end data in JavaScript to the back end of Omni*Web server, which then translate the commands to PHP functions for writing the data to the filesystem:

         f(': B_AUTH1 HTTP SESSION: AUTH i: PBK i: o_hash.json l_cdwjs h_b64 dup: last '+ 
         utoa(S[2][1].value) +' b64d: 2 pick: s:'+ (false?' last rg: newest 5 4 sspl: 
         old_record swap: 0 i: last 4 replace: isodt: 0 replace: dup: 2 i: 3 replace: 2 pick: 
         2 replace: 1 pick: 5 replace: mk_hash wm1 nl: . . wm2 s: ':' reply_to g_x 0 i: 
         old_record swap: 0 i: last 4 replace: isodt: 0 replace: dup: 2 i: 3 replace: 2 pick: 
         2 replace: 1 pick: 5 replace: mk_hash wm1 nl: . . . wm2 s: ')+'; : A_AUTH1 B: 
         B_AUTH1 F_O ; A_AUTH1')


We cited this example as this is one of the most common operations used in web services, so programmers familiar with various programming languages may verify how much native programming language code will be required to perform the same function. Obviously, one of the most important feature of metaprogramming is macro, that is to say any combination of words shown in this example can further be shortened using macros, where ``` : B_AUTH1 …. ; ``` ( colon NAME definitions semicolon ) itself is a macro definition, otherwise known as Colon Definition Word in the FORTH programming language, from which Phoscript is derived.

Notice that Phoscript is unifying both JavaScript and PHP in the above example and can be ported to any other known host programming languages, thus making learning programming much easier in the future. 

### Conclusions: Digital Assets & Wealth Redistribution 

This article explores novel algorithms to manage digital assets of users and free software programmers, with the aim of achieving redistribution of wealth without violent means.

We discussed Omni\*Web RCDC plan, which includes rural (R) and city (C) development and training programs and decentralised cryptography (D) and metaprogramming modules (C) of Omni*Web. The rural and city development and training programs were inspired by the success of free software projects and communities, which demonstrated that open and transparent sharing of knowledge of free software has successfully created critical software modules used by MMAGA, whose combined revenues in 2024 nearly reached USD 1.8 trillion. 

This means we utilise plots of land space as measures of digital assets, consisting of knowledge and training in plant nursery and aquatics, which can be rented and reinvested to recruit more trainees and to create more digital assets, providing a zero barriers of entry for trainees with little to no initial wealth. The same mechanisms exist in free software communities where knowledge is shared and created. Cooking classes are the other type of digital assets that can be acquired with zero initial capital. 

We introduce cooking classes and agricultural training as the foundations for ordinary users to understand and appreciate digital assets and how to manage them, as no other governments, companies or organisations to date are responsible for the education of the most important asset class in the age of Metaverse.

After acquiring knowledge and income from the rural and city training programs, users may then embark on further understanding of Crypto-Metaprogramming, concerning techniques of managing the most important asset class in the age of Metaverse, and eventually recruit and train enough people to establish Metanarchy cells, much like the Foundation in Isaac Asimov's Foundation fiction universe, paving the way for a Star Trek like future, and making Asimov's visions a reality. 

Some may suggest there is no lack of examples of digital assets in today's social media platforms. Unfortunately, in order for Omni*Web to compete with MMAGA and other established players, without real world rural and city development and training programs, would be an almost impossible task. 

On the contrary, Omni\*Web real world rural and city development and training programs are a blue ocean strategy where no governments, companies or organisations seem to be interested in addressing. As such, these training programs shall help Omni*Web recruit its initial membership and accumulate capital for expanding its software development team.

Omni*Web is a free software or open source project, aimed at creating a truly decentralised web ecosystem, owned and operated by free individual users and free software programmers, employing the following breakthrough technologies:

The main keywords above are “truly decentralised web ecosystem, owned and operated”, and the essence lies in the word “owned”, a very common and important English word that is used daily, but poorly defined in the digital realm and yet very few people are aware of the consequences of lacking awareness on ownerships of digital assets, which is one of the educational goals Omni*Web aims to achieve.

### Commoditization of Compositional Intelligence

The magic of Omni*Web can be summarised in 4 words: “commoditization of compositional intelligence.”

“Compositional intelligence” is an inherent skill that human beings acquire and use in almost all kinds of tasks. It can be codified using metaprogramming scripts such as FORTH and its derivatives, specifically Phoscript in Omni*Web ecosystem, with examples ranging from adding two numbers (3 4 +), to sending messages in social media platforms ( “how are you?” send: ) and managing AI training data ( data_hash model train: ).

Metaprogramming scripts transform tasks of arbitrary complexity into standardized string formats, which can be converted to hash codes, and associated with hash codes representing user identity, to become digital assets with ownership, also specified using hash codes. As such, “compositional intelligence”, namely the ability of every user to perform a wide range of tasks, can be codified and commoditized, hence lowering the barriers of everyone to acquire highly complex skills, and enabling them to work together to build sophisticated systems to compete with established companies with huge capital and long history. 

In plain English, it means:

- I can acquire sophisticated skills from Omni*Web and contribute my parts to compete with MMAGA if I have time and patience to learn. 


## Omnia Vincit Scientia

- Knowledge conquers all.

Mainstream European historians prefer to believe that Gutenberg invented the printing press, rather than the hypothesis that such "inventions" were copied from China.

If the European printing press machine was copied from China, then it is also reasonable to hypothesise than a significant portion of Renaissance knowledge in the arts and sciences (scientia) was also copied and translated from Chinese sources. 

We mention these politically incorrect historiographic hypotheses to illistrate "omnia vincit scientia" or "knowledge conquers all", where pre-Renaissance European barbarians managed to dominate the world with copied Chinese arts and sciences, and therefore, whomever dominate the world today can also be conquered by "nova scientia" or "new knowledge". 

- WHAT do we want to "conquer"?

In the following sections, we elaborate the background problems that Omni*Web aims to solve:

  - [Why Omni*Web?](https://omnixtar.github.io/why/)
  - [MMAGA Dilemmas](https://omnixtar.github.io/MMAGA/)

- The Power of Anonymous Free Software Programmers

<img src="https://omnixtar.github.io/why/MMAGA-2023-2024.png">

MMAGA revenue chart is perhaps the most vivid illustration of the power of free software programmers, as they are the real heroes who composed the source code of the programs that power the Internet and mobile devices in your hands.

As we explained in [MMAGA Dilemmas](https://omnixtar.github.io/MMAGA/), a significant but unknown portion of source code used in MMAGA and other commercial systems is contributed by free software programmers.

As such, using Omnihash and DJSON Decentralised JSON, we may integrate and consolidate all existing free software programmers, and include more new programmers and users using simplified metaprogramming techniques with Phoscript, and accomplish greater achievements compared to MMAGA, which we call "Metanarchy", or decentralised self governing system based on transactions in the Metaverse.

For DJAX demonstration,  you may just press the LIKE button for this article, which generates a DJSON, which in turn is simply a JSON string consisting one or more Omnihash code, 

The DJSON string is compressed using GZIP and encoded as URL safe base64 string, and sent to one of the 3 following options for storage:

1. Omni*Web I2P (Invisible Internet Project) server
2. NGROK 
3. GitHub Issues

How does simply adding Omnihash or compatible hash codes to JSON strings make DJAX the biggest breakthrough since AJAX?

This is due to the many powerful cybersecurity properties associated with hash codes that are usually overshadowed by other fanciers algorithms. 

We will illustrate the properties of Omnihash or hash codes with examples. The first example shown here is simply a like on this very article. The DJSON will record the following:

<img src="https://omnixtar.github.io//img/djson-like.png" height="60">

In the JSON string shown above,

- `"like"` is user's action.
- `"user_hash"` is a dummy string where a user's identifier hash code can be inserted. See ... for example ...
- `{"href":"https://omnixtar.github.io/djax/" ...}` is the URL of this article plus other additional information.
- `"2025-03-19T11:35:29.365Z"` is the timestamp.

As you can see, `user_hash` and timestamp will be unique and thus the hash code or Omnihash generated from this JSON string, `FCrM-oxkcg==`, will be "cryptographically unique" as the look-up address.

Omnihash shown above `FCrM-oxkcg==` can be used to retrieve DJSON from various storage (back-end) platforms, including but not limited to: 

1. I2P (Invisible Internet Project)

20 years have elapsed between AJAX and DJAX, a Decentralised version of the former, one of the most fundamental operations for sending data between front end browser or application and back end server.

One may conjecture in hindsight what delayed the transition from AJAX to DJAX, given all the essential technologies existed way back in 2005. The Occam's razor answer might be MMAGA obstructions, given that if DJAX eventually command 0.1% of MMAGA revenues by 2030 which would exceed USD 1 billion annually. 

The above conjecture can be verified using DJAX as it spreads to include more server nodes contributed by free individual users and free software programmers. , with a theoretical upper limit engulfing all devices owned by individual users and free software programmers, practically exceeding those owned by non biological corporations. 

So perhaps the simplicity of DJAX and the lack of explanation of its delay may be equally interesting to the potential of DJAX to create a truly Decentralised web ecosystem owned and operated by free individual users and free software programmers.

DJSON or Decesntralised JSON is a critical breakthrough by Omni*Web where base 64 hash codes representing any kind of digital assets and entities, from user identifiers to social media actions such as like, comment and share, are embedded in the unassuming ubiquitous JSON strings.

Underlying decentralised JSON is an extension of the Bitcoin address, which is derived from the hash of a public key, to be used as a user identifier. The generalisation of the hash of public key as user identifier is a breakthrough in decentralised computing, as previous frameworks based on blockchains or cryptocurrencies are heavily monopolised by miners.

What makes DJSON so special and powerful is what we call "type preservation property" of hash numbers and integers, which is derived from Ring theory properties of integers, where the operations of additon and multiplication on integers invariably result in integers as output. 

The previous paragraph may sound like your typical high school mathematics nightmare, but it is the biggest secret underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well as novel decentralised social media platforms as we shall see in the following example:

- how to add a like function to **this** GitHub markdown article

We will reveal the answer first and explain later as we assume there are readers who are impatient: 

- ```["2025-02-11T14:25:28.207+0000","like","CXAGcRKevA==","CXAGcRKevA==","HymWBzfj9A==","HymWBzfj9A== s: x:"]```

In the DJSON above, the fields are:

- timestamp, action, current_user_ID, prev_msg_owner, doc_hash, messages

doc_hash means hash of URL of document.

The following are the steps for generating the "like" DJSON of this article, accompanied by a video:

1. Save a copy of this web page as a local file on Omni*Web server.
2. Generate doc_hash for this document.
3. Make a subdirectory for this document with doc_hash.
4. Copy neccessary files and soft links.
5. Open the local copy on [Omni*Web server](https://yo6sgmfq7pfvvp2e4kcuhjtfg7wfltt63igwcukhbmuqm6lu3a3a.b32.i2p/h/E5bnwoBdvg==/?nn=z) using I2P (Invisible Internet Project) and doc_hash.
6. Start Omni*Shell from browser console.
7. Refresh authentication token with user's public key.
8. Send "like" DJSON from browser console using Omni*Shell Phoscript commands.

If the steps above look daunting to you then you will be pleased to know that those are exactly what happen millions of times per seconds around the world when "like" buttons are clicked on social media platforms -- except that YOU, the users and free software programmers, ***do not OWN and OPERATE any part of that, and therefore CANNOT make any money out of it***.

... which brings us to Omni\*Web aim -- to create a truly decentralised web ecosystem, **OWNED and OPERATED by free individual users and free software programmers, capable of providing free alternatives to ALL existing services** provided by the biggest trillion dollar corporations such as MMAGA -- a funny abbreviation for Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Google and Apple.

Omni\*Web will attempt to improve Jekyll's documentation, as we shall do for other free software projects too, 

This article itself will demonstrate several features of Omni*Web aiming at improving Jekyll documentation and promoting it, as well as introduce metaprogramming features that can be used to extend Jekyll's functionalities.

One of Omni*Web most important innovation is Decentralised Full Stack Programming (DFSP).

### Decentralised Full Stack Programming using Hash

Full stack programming has evolved out of the need to coordinate web browser front end and server back end functionalities. Over many years, many frameworks have been developed and front end modules have now included mobile device environments. Their complexities have grown exponentially and we now proposed a decentralised programming paradigm based on hashes, greatly simplifying overall full stack operations. 

To summarise the whole idea before delving into details, we present an example where a user responds to a post with a comment on a GitHub page, where the URL of the original post and the user's comment, as well as the user's identifier are represented by hashes, and these hashes can be hashed using a hash function to produce a root hash, representing the overall transaction. 

The user may submit the transaction JSON and its hash to a server independently operating unrelated to the GitHub page server, as long as it understands and complies with the protocols determined by the hashes. 


A user may claim the same identity with different hash identifiers as long as they can prove the chain of identities by verifying ciphers using the private key for each of the identities. 


#### Jekyll

Jekyll in a nutshell is like a pure front end MVC framework, so that mega websites like GitHub will feel safe to provide pseudo MVC features to its users, in this case, primarily programmers.

Jekyll is the default markdown document parser on GitHub, which is very powerful, but unfortunately has some rather confusing documentation and not so easy to debug.







- cdw: ak: x:
- Enter the above in the nickname (adam) chat box. Click the nickname (adam) button to execute.
- cdw: Read all colon definition words in SESSION()
- ak: array_keys() extract array keys from associative array (JSON like)
- x: sends chat box expressions by AJAX to backend.

### Decentralised Monetised Collaboration 

Demon Collab 

Demon’s Con

Omni*DOC

It is interesting how word tricks in English and Latin play out.

The Latin root of “collaborate” is “con” + “laboro”, where “con” is a variation of “cum” meaning “with”.

As such, Decentralised Monetised Collaboration is shortened as “Demon's Con”.

We will tentatively use Demon's Con as the nickname for Decentralised Monetised Collaboration, as we have received feedback that the cryptocurrency industry now has such a bad reputation that we might as well use a Latin word trick to engage users. 

We know some self proclaimed Christians have long associated cryptography with the works of Demons, in folklores like 666. We are interested in engaging in conversation with Christians or any self proclaimed believers in monotheistic religions as we are aware that there are many countries which still practise laws that may prosecute anyone unilaterally as conducting blasphemy, some punishable by death, in 2025 Anno Domino.

However, bringing up Christian demons and 666 also appeals to a large number of fans who are critical of Christian traditions as well as those affected by bad publicity about cryptocurrency and decentralised technologies, bearing in mind that the Washington Wall Street elites prefer to brainwash the American population so that they continue to maintain their monopoly of power in politics and finance.

As the name suggests, Decentralised Monetised Collaboration consists of 3 components: Decentralised infrastructure, Monetisation Legal Framework and Collaborative Transactions.

Collaborative transactions are the most common as they include everything from Google documents to TikTok posts. 

Decentralised infrastructure includes everything from I2P invisible internet project which enables everyone to set up server hosts connected to Internet without the Domain Name System, to Omnihash which is a novel hash algorithm for representing ownership of any kind of digital assets. 

Monetised Legal Framework means employing decentralised hash algorithms to establish digital legal contracts, including loans, payments and investments. 

What can we achieve by combining all 3 components of Decentralisation, Monetisation and Collaboration?

Adding Decentralisation to Collaboration will produce a UNIFIED interface to collaborative transactions. In plain English, it will enable you to combine posts and comments from ALL social media platforms into one integrated platform. 

For example, one of the biggest bottlenecks of chatting with artificial intelligence systems is that the conversation results cannot be automatically published, shared and put into collaboration with other users or AI systems.

With Omni*DOC, where D stands for Decentralisation, O for Oro or gold in Spanish, C for collaboration, a user’s conversation with any AI systems can be republished, shared, commented and so on just like any existing social media posts. 

Omni\*DOC will behave very differently from conventional social media platforms where the operator of the platform will appoint or employ moderators to filter inappropriate speeches. On Omni*DOC however, users themselves may make the decision to choose custom filters to filter out posts or comments that they themselves deem inappropriate. 

Omni*DOC works by first converting any URL into a hash code, which can be anything from 53 bits to 512 bits or longer. 

Secondly, the hash of URL of HURL will be shared amongst servers running Omni*Web modules.

Thirdly, any of Omni*Web servers may decide to create cache copies of a given URL for further processing. 

Up to this stage, Omni\*Web behaves like a Decentralised cache and search network, i.e. instead of a huge centralised search engine operated by one company such as Google or Microsoft, the power of Omni\*Web depends on the number server nodes participating. It basically works like Waybackmachine but its functionalities can be extended by any user or programmers, as long as they conform to Omni*Contract conditions and protocols. 

Social media functionalities exist from step 4 onwards. Although there exist differences amongst social media platforms, different user interface elements are essentially functions which can be represented as paths in graph theory. Further, different paths are represented as hashes, as the ring properties of integers ensure hashes can be concatenated as input to produce an output hash which is also another integer. We may call this property type preservation, namely, the types of inputs and output are preserved. The type preservation property of hashes makes it convenient to manage various types of functions on social media applications. 

First 3 stages, multiply servers. Applying hash in server address.

Stage 4, multiply functionalities. Applying hash in data address. 

In conventional MVC programming, function calls and data types are tightly coupled to types of data and how they are processed. In hash metaprogramming, everything is hash and hashes are compatible with each other due to type preservation property. 

Hash applicable in server and data addresses due to type preservation property. 


### Omni*DOC Example

This document itself is an example of Omni*DOC anyone may comment, share and follow up etc or add functions they wish.

Move this up as it is easiest to understand.

For example, chat results with AI, repost, comments, follow up.
