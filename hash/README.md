- ### [Cardano Grille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardan_grille)

16th century Italian cryptographer Girolamo Cardano was attritbuted to have recorded a method using a cardboard with holes to convey a secret message, where letters are seen through holes when placed on a specific page on a designated book. This technique has thus been named Cardano grille, which would become a predecessor of today's hash algorithms. 

We highlighted the history of Girolamo Cardano to demonstrate that, not even the Pope may physically compel anyone to reveal any information unwillingly, which becomes the legitimate foundation of Metanarchy.

### Legitimacy of Modern Nation States

Although mainstream American historians prefer to proclaim the year 1776 as the founding year of the United States of America, it was the Treaty of Paris in 1783 that officially marked the recognition by the British Crown.

However, it was not until the
[Voting Rights Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965), that "coloured voters" in USA were finally given the rights to vote, almost two decades later than ordinary pariah Indians since India's independence from British rule.


### Hash Functions & Public Key Cryptography

[Hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) & [Public Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) were introduced in the 1950s and 1970s respectively but it was not until 2009 that the launch of Bitcoin demonstrated the viability of decentralised information infrastructure, which shall form the fundamental algorithms for Metanarchy.

So indeed the computational foundation of Metanarchy and the legal framework of modern nation states (voting rights for coloured voters) were both established around 1970s.

Omnisophia means a Decentralised intelligent system *owned and operated by free individuals and free software programmers*. Omni meaning everything in Latin is just a disguise of the banned word proletariat or belonging to the ordinary people. Sophia is of course intelligence.

Metanarchy means a new form of global and local governance based on transactions in the Metaverse. Political philosophers a century ago would coin the term anarchy for the lack of understanding to describe a system of governance without physical forms. Metanarchy would be the ultimate answer.

Omni\*Doc (pronounced "Omni Star Doc") or OXD is inspired by Project Xanadu, the World Wide Web, as well as several other predecessors. Its current format seeks to minimise user's efforts and maximise their effects,

- (Metaprogramming) by employing FORTH derived metaprogramming scripts on lines of texts, 
- (Omnisophia) to produce publicly accessible documents stored on Omni*Web nodes, using secure decentralised protocols.

- ### Ultimate Goals of Decentralisation

While this initial may look strange, it is in many respect the ultimate goal behind various decentralisation trends, from BitTorrent, Invisible Internet Project (I2P) to Bitcoin.

## Bitcoin Address: Hash of Public Key

The implementation of the Bitcoin address as the hash of public key is a crucial breakthrough in decentralised systems. However, along with it, serious misconceptions regarding the hash of public key were propagated, misleading many to believe that no solutions exist beyond the blockchain architecture.

Omni*Web is here to demonstrate a very lightweight implementation of the hash of public key being used as user identifiers, together with a whole body of hash calculus for all kinds of decentralised data and transactions.
