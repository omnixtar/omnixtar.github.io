To illustrate the simplest and …. Application of Omnihash ….. 

Omnilevel Marketing 

Amway is notorious or well known, depending on your perspective, for spreading multilevel marketing around the world. If we create a mathematical model for multilevel marketing, then we may conclude that variables like Omnihash and DJSON Decentralised JSON would remove the “toxic” elements in multilevel marketing, namely to record the act of recommendation as a credit token, instead of extracting cash payments from “downlines” to “uplines”. 

As such, users and programmers using Omni*Web may use Omnihash and DJSON to recruit “downlines” and enjoy all benefits without “toxic” payouts, and become early bird “uplines” of possibly the largest multilevel network ever in human history, as there shall only be one Omni*Web for the entire universe. 

Multilevel marketing is Omnihash biggest and easiest selling point!!

Omnilevel Marketing (OLM), namely Multilevel Marketing (MLM) using Omnihash as user identifiers and transaction identifiers, might be the most significant and innovative breakthrough since the birth of Multilevel Marketing itself, as OLM completely removes the cash payment element from MLM, changing the “parasitic” nature of MLM to “synergistic”.

MLM operates by extracting a small percentage of the sales generated by “downlines” or N level agents to reward “uplines”, or agents at level N-1, N-2, …, 3, 2, 1.

The costs of expanding an MLM network is usually borne by the recruitee, who will pay around 5 times equivalent of a Starbucks frappe to “join” the network, with the promise that the “joining fee” shall be recovered from payments and revenues of “downlines” recruited by the agent. 

Compare this mechanism to the plain and simple “words of mouth”, the costs and benefits of “words of mouth” cannot be measured or quantified, unless we use Omnihash and DJSON Decentralised JSON as the tokens for recommendations, which is known as Omni*Marketing.

As such, Omni*Marketing combines the best of multilevel marketing and “words of mouth”, by removing the cost component to be paid by the recruitee, making the cost of recommendation almost zero, and unifying all sectors and businesses with one generic decentralised identifier, namely Omnihash, further reducing the costs of creating independent multilevel networks, owned by separate business operators.

## Omni*Web Implementation Plan

Any business can use Omni*Marketing for free and pay later.

In terms of Omni\*Web Implementation Plan (OIP), Omni*Marketing is the first and simplest application to be implemented, but coincidentally also the most generic application that can be used by all kinds of businesses and users. 

Any business owner may now start using Omni*Marketing by visiting the following website or installing the following app:

Omni*Marketing operates by “use first, pay later” principle . 

Business owners may decide to join existing Omni*Marketing business networks, or set up their own independent business networks, based on terms and conditions agreed by all parties concerned.

The biggest innovations of Omni*Marketing and Omni*Web are as follows: 

One click to generate Omnihash representing user identifier and DJSON Decentralised JSON for digital contract (Omni*Contract).
Users may regenerate Omni*Contract and DJSON anytime to reflect new terms and conditions.

Step 1 reduces a typical conventional user registration step that would take at least 5 minutes to less than 5 seconds, quite literally. Further, conventional user registration relies on centralised database management systems, and requires real world identity such as email address or phone number, which makes many users hesitant or reluctant to sign up. Omnihash removes these obstacles by employing public key cryptography and uses the hash of public key as user's identifier, a scheme widely used in cryptocurrency and blockchain systems including Bitcoin.

Step 2 simplifies paper based contract handling that typically takes several days to merely several minutes, quite literally the duration required to compose and modify contract templates and press approve or agree buttons. 

These innovations span multiple domains and disciplines, from cryptography to metaprogramming and decentralised algorithms, thus may appear as an oxymoron like Monty Python's Holy Grail, the likelihood of a group of British comedians actually discovering the mythical Biblical relic. 

Nevertheless, Omni*Web being a free software and open source project, every line of code can be examined and verified, and consequently, every claim we make here can be examined and verified, unlike the stories in Monty Python and some others.

## Phoscript Metaprogramming

1\. Payout: back end algorithms 

2\. GUI

3\. others 
- girls, 
- promotion, 
- multilevel network effects


As for factor (2) GUI, Phoscript metaprogramming shall play a crucial role, as it provides a simplified and unified script that is omnilingual, omnipotent and omni-environment, which overcomes significant drawbacks in recent GUI programming, namely frequent updates in programming languages and, too many variants and changes in Model-View-Controller related frameworks.

Consequences of Phoscript metaprogramming ….. Omni*App one super app, collective effort to improve front end and back end …. 

Phoscript metaprogramming not only simplifies and unifies commands across programming languages and operating system environments. Together with Omnihash and DJSON Decentralised JSON, they monetise and stratify (classify in layers) the data and scripts contributed by users and programmers as collective digital assets.

In this way, users and programmers are motivated and incentivised by the values of the collective digital assets to collaborate, much like they would within a corporate environment, but with collective digital assets replacing company shares and cash payments. 



### Omni*Web: A Truly Decentralised Web Ecosystem
- ... Owned & Operated by Free Individual Users & Free Software Programmers

Omni*Web is a free software or open source project, aimed at creating a truly decentralised web ecosystem, owned and operated by free individual users and free software programmers, employing the following breakthrough technologies:

<!-- put links here -->

- [I2P Invisible Internet Project](https://geti2p.net/en/), 
- [Omnihash](https://omnixtar.github.io/omnihash/)
- [DJSON Decentralised JSON](https://omnixtar.github.io/djson/)
- [Phoscript metaprogramming script]().


The main keywords above are “truly decentralised web ecosystem, owned and operated”, and the essence lies in the word “owned”, a very common and important English word that is used daily, but poorly defined in the digital realm and yet very few people are aware of the consequences of lacking awareness on ownerships of digital assets, which is one of the educational goals Omni*Web aims to achieve.

### Commoditization of Compositional Intelligence

The magic of Omni*Web can be summarised in 4 words: “commoditization of compositional intelligence.”

“Compositional intelligence” is an inherent skill that human beings acquire and use in almost all kinds of tasks. It can be codified using metaprogramming scripts such as FORTH and its derivatives, specifically Phoscript in Omni*Web ecosystem, with examples ranging from adding two numbers (3 4 +), to sending messages in social media platforms ( “how are you?” send: ) and managing AI training data ( data_hash model train: ).

Metaprogramming scripts transform tasks of arbitrary complexity into standardized string formats, which can be converted to hash codes, and associated with hash codes representing user identity, to become digital assets with ownership, also specified using hash codes. As such, “compositional intelligence”, namely the ability of every user to perform a wide range of tasks, can be codified and commoditized, hence lowering the barriers of everyone to acquire highly complex skills, and enabling them to work together to build sophisticated systems to compete with established companies with huge capital and long history. 

In plain English, it means:

I can acquire sophisticated skills from Omni*Web and contribute my parts to compete with MMAGA if I have time and patience to learn.

For DJAX demonstration,  you may just press the LIKE button for this article, which generates a DJSON, which in turn is simply a JSON string consisting one or more Omnihash code, 

The DJSON string is compressed using GZIP and encoded as URL safe base64 string, and sent to one of the 3 following options for storage:

1. Omni*Web I2P (Invisible Internet Project) server
2. NGROK 
3. GitHub Issues

How does simply adding Omnihash or compatible hash codes to JSON strings make DJAX the biggest breakthrough since AJAX?

This is due to the many powerful cybersecurity properties associated with hash codes that are usually overshadowed by other fanciers algorithms. 

We will illustrate the properties of Omnihash or hash codes with examples. The first example shown here is simply a like on this very article. The DJSON will record the following:

<img src="https://omnixtar.github.io//img/djson-like.png" height="60">

In the JSON string shown above,

- `"like"` is user's action.
- `"user_hash"` is a dummy string where a user's identifier hash code can be inserted. See ... for example ...
- `{"href":"https://omnixtar.github.io/djax/" ...}` is the URL of this article plus other additional information.
- `"2025-03-19T11:35:29.365Z"` is the timestamp.

As you can see, `user_hash` and timestamp will be unique and thus the hash code or Omnihash generated from this JSON string, `FCrM-oxkcg==`, will be "cryptographically unique" as the look-up address.

Omnihash shown above `FCrM-oxkcg==` can be used to retrieve DJSON from various storage (back-end) platforms, including but not limited to: 

1. I2P (Invisible Internet Project)
2. NGROK
3. GitHub Issues

20 years have elapsed between AJAX and DJAX, a Decentralised version of the former, one of the most fundamental operations for sending data between front end browser or application and back end server.

One may conjecture in hindsight what delayed the transition from AJAX to DJAX, given all the essential technologies existed way back in 2005. The Occam's razor answer might be MMAGA obstructions, given that if DJAX eventually command 0.1% of MMAGA revenues by 2030 which would exceed USD 1 billion annually. 

The above conjecture can be verified using DJAX as it spreads to include more server nodes contributed by free individual users and free software programmers. , with a theoretical upper limit engulfing all devices owned by individual users and free software programmers, practically exceeding those owned by non biological corporations. 

So perhaps the simplicity of DJAX and the lack of explanation of its delay may be equally interesting to the potential of DJAX to create a truly Decentralised web ecosystem owned and operated by free individual users and free software programmers.

DJSON or Decesntralised JSON is a critical breakthrough by Omni*Web where base 64 hash codes representing any kind of digital assets and entities, from user identifiers to social media actions such as like, comment and share, are embedded in the unassuming ubiquitous JSON strings.

Underlying decentralised JSON is an extension of the Bitcoin address, which is derived from the hash of a public key, to be used as a user identifier. The generalisation of the hash of public key as user identifier is a breakthrough in decentralised computing, as previous frameworks based on blockchains or cryptocurrencies are heavily monopolised by miners.

What makes DJSON so special and powerful is what we call "type preservation property" of hash numbers and integers, which is derived from Ring theory properties of integers, where the operations of additon and multiplication on integers invariably result in integers as output. 

The previous paragraph may sound like your typical high school mathematics nightmare, but it is the biggest secret underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well as novel decentralised social media platforms as we shall see in the following example:

- how to add a like function to **this** GitHub markdown article

We will reveal the answer first and explain later as we assume there are readers who are impatient: 

- ```["2025-02-11T14:25:28.207+0000","like","CXAGcRKevA==","CXAGcRKevA==","HymWBzfj9A==","HymWBzfj9A== s: x:"]```

In the DJSON above, the fields are:

- timestamp, action, current_user_ID, prev_msg_owner, doc_hash, messages

doc_hash means hash of URL of document.

The following are the steps for generating the "like" DJSON of this article, accompanied by a video:

1. Save a copy of this web page as a local file on Omni*Web server.
2. Generate doc_hash for this document.
3. Make a subdirectory for this document with doc_hash.
4. Copy neccessary files and soft links.
5. Open the local copy on [Omni*Web server](https://yo6sgmfq7pfvvp2e4kcuhjtfg7wfltt63igwcukhbmuqm6lu3a3a.b32.i2p/h/E5bnwoBdvg==/?nn=z) using I2P (Invisible Internet Project) and doc_hash.
6. Start Omni*Shell from browser console.
7. Refresh authentication token with user's public key.
8. Send "like" DJSON from browser console using Omni*Shell Phoscript commands.

If the steps above look daunting to you then you will be pleased to know that those are exactly what happen millions of times per seconds around the world when "like" buttons are clicked on social media platforms -- except that YOU, the users and free software programmers, ***do not OWN and OPERATE any part of that, and therefore CANNOT make any money out of it***.

... which brings us to Omni\*Web aim -- to create a truly decentralised web ecosystem, **OWNED and OPERATED by free individual users and free software programmers, capable of providing free alternatives to ALL existing services** provided by the biggest trillion dollar corporations such as MMAGA -- a funny abbreviation for Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Google and Apple.

Omni\*Web will attempt to improve Jekyll's documentation, as we shall do for other free software projects too, 

This article itself will demonstrate several features of Omni*Web aiming at improving Jekyll documentation and promoting it, as well as introduce metaprogramming features that can be used to extend Jekyll's functionalities.

One of Omni*Web most important innovation is Decentralised Full Stack Programming (DFSP).

### Decentralised Full Stack Programming using Hash

Full stack programming has evolved out of the need to coordinate web browser front end and server back end functionalities. Over many years, many frameworks have been developed and front end modules have now included mobile device environments. Their complexities have grown exponentially and we now proposed a decentralised programming paradigm based on hashes, greatly simplifying overall full stack operations. 

To summarise the whole idea before delving into details, we present an example where a user responds to a post with a comment on a GitHub page, where the URL of the original post and the user's comment, as well as the user's identifier are represented by hashes, and these hashes can be hashed using a hash function to produce a root hash, representing the overall transaction. 

The user may submit the transaction JSON and its hash to a server independently operating unrelated to the GitHub page server, as long as it understands and complies with the protocols determined by the hashes. 


A user may claim the same identity with different hash identifiers as long as they can prove the chain of identities by verifying ciphers using the private key for each of the identities. 


#### Jekyll

Jekyll in a nutshell is like a pure front end MVC framework, so that mega websites like GitHub will feel safe to provide pseudo MVC features to its users, in this case, primarily programmers.

Jekyll is the default markdown document parser on GitHub, which is very powerful, but unfortunately has some rather confusing documentation and not so easy to debug.







- cdw: ak: x:
- Enter the above in the nickname (adam) chat box. Click the nickname (adam) button to execute.
- cdw: Read all colon definition words in SESSION()
- ak: array_keys() extract array keys from associative array (JSON like)
- x: sends chat box expressions by AJAX to backend.

### Decentralised Monetised Collaboration 

Demon Collab 

Demon’s Con

Omni*DOC

It is interesting how word tricks in English and Latin play out.

The Latin root of “collaborate” is “con” + “laboro”, where “con” is a variation of “cum” meaning “with”.

As such, Decentralised Monetised Collaboration is shortened as “Demon's Con”.

We will tentatively use Demon's Con as the nickname for Decentralised Monetised Collaboration, as we have received feedback that the cryptocurrency industry now has such a bad reputation that we might as well use a Latin word trick to engage users. 

We know some self proclaimed Christians have long associated cryptography with the works of Demons, in folklores like 666. We are interested in engaging in conversation with Christians or any self proclaimed believers in monotheistic religions as we are aware that there are many countries which still practise laws that may prosecute anyone unilaterally as conducting blasphemy, some punishable by death, in 2025 Anno Domino.

However, bringing up Christian demons and 666 also appeals to a large number of fans who are critical of Christian traditions as well as those affected by bad publicity about cryptocurrency and decentralised technologies, bearing in mind that the Washington Wall Street elites prefer to brainwash the American population so that they continue to maintain their monopoly of power in politics and finance. 


Decentralised Monetised Collaboration 

Demon Collab 

Demon’s Con

As the name suggests, Decentralised Monetised Collaboration consists of 3 components: Decentralised infrastructure, Monetisation Legal Framework and Collaborative Transactions.

Collaborative transactions are the most common as they include everything from Google documents to TikTok posts. 

Decentralised infrastructure includes everything from I2P invisible internet project which enables everyone to set up server hosts connected to Internet without the Domain Name System, to Omnihash which is a novel hash algorithm for representing ownership of any kind of digital assets. 

Monetised Legal Framework means employing decentralised hash algorithms to establish digital legal contracts, including loans, payments and investments. 

What can we achieve by combining all 3 components of Decentralisation, Monetisation and Collaboration?

Adding Decentralisation to Collaboration will produce a UNIFIED interface to collaborative transactions. In plain English, it will enable you to combine posts and comments from ALL social media platforms into one integrated platform. 

For example, one of the biggest bottlenecks of chatting with artificial intelligence systems is that the conversation results cannot be automatically published, shared and put into collaboration with other users or AI systems.

With Omni*DOC, where D stands for Decentralisation, O for Oro or gold in Spanish, C for collaboration, a user’s conversation with any AI systems can be republished, shared, commented and so on just like any existing social media posts. 

Omni\*DOC will behave very differently from conventional social media platforms where the operator of the platform will appoint or employ moderators to filter inappropriate speeches. On Omni*DOC however, users themselves may make the decision to choose custom filters to filter out posts or comments that they themselves deem inappropriate. 

Omni*DOC works by first converting any URL into a hash code, which can be anything from 53 bits to 512 bits or longer. 

Secondly, the hash of URL of HURL will be shared amongst servers running Omni*Web modules.

Thirdly, any of Omni*Web servers may decide to create cache copies of a given URL for further processing. 

Up to this stage, Omni\*Web behaves like a Decentralised cache and search network, i.e. instead of a huge centralised search engine operated by one company such as Google or Microsoft, the power of Omni\*Web depends on the number server nodes participating. It basically works like Waybackmachine but its functionalities can be extended by any user or programmers, as long as they conform to Omni*Contract conditions and protocols. 

Social media functionalities exist from step 4 onwards. Although there exist differences amongst social media platforms, different user interface elements are essentially functions which can be represented as paths in graph theory. Further, different paths are represented as hashes, as the ring properties of integers ensure hashes can be concatenated as input to produce an output hash which is also another integer. We may call this property type preservation, namely, the types of inputs and output are preserved. The type preservation property of hashes makes it convenient to manage various types of functions on social media applications. 

First 3 stages, multiply servers. Applying hash in server address.

Stage 4, multiply functionalities. Applying hash in data address. 

In conventional MVC programming, function calls and data types are tightly coupled to types of data and how they are processed. In hash metaprogramming, everything is hash and hashes are compatible with each other due to type preservation property. 

Hash applicable in server and data addresses due to type preservation property.
