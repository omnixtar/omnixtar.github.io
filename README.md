# Omni* Omnixtar

Omnixtar is a Latin transcription of "Omni*", which is itself a tautology or pleonasm, in that * is the wildcard character in UNIX derived systems or langauges, and Omni is a Latin word that means the same. We use "xtar" instead of "star" simply because "omnistar" username has been taken on GitHub.

Omni* currently consists of the following
1. Omnihash
2. Omnishell
3. OmniGDB (Graph Database)
